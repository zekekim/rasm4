Line 1: 
Line 2: By Dr. Seuss
Line 3: 
Line 4: The sun did not shine.
Line 5: It was too wet to play.
Line 6: So we sat in the house
Line 7: All that cold, cold, wet day.
Line 8: 
Line 9: I sat there with Sally.
Line 10: We sat there, we two.
Line 11: And I said, "How I wish
Line 12: We had something to do!"
Line 13: 
Line 14: Too wet to go out
Line 15: And too cold to play ball.
Line 16: So we sat in the house.
Line 17: We did nothing at all.
Line 18: 
Line 19: So all we could do was to
Line 20: 
Line 21: Sit!
Line 22: Sit!
Line 23: Sit!
Line 24: Sit!
Line 25: 
Line 26: And we did not like it.
Line 27: Not one little bit.
Line 28: 
Line 29: BUMP!
Line 30: 
Line 31: And then
Line 32: something went BUMP!
Line 33: How that bump made us jump!
Line 34: 
Line 35: We looked!
Line 36: Then we saw him step in on the mat!
Line 37: We looked!
Line 38: And we saw him!
Line 39: The Cat in the Hat!
Line 40: And he said to us,
Line 41: "Why do you sit there like that?"
Line 42: "I know it is wet
Line 43: And the sun is not sunny.
Line 44: But we can have
Line 45: Lots of good fun that is funny!"
Line 46: 
Line 47: "I know some good games we could play,"
Line 48: Said the cat.
Line 49: "I know some new tricks,"
Line 50: Said the Cat in the Hat.
Line 51: "A lot of good tricks.
Line 52: I will show them to you.
Line 53: Your mother
Line 54: Will not mind at all if I do."
Line 55: 
Line 56: Then Sally and I
Line 57: Did not know what to say.
Line 58: Our mother was out of the house
Line 59: For the day.
Line 60: 
Line 61: But our fish said, "No! No!
Line 62: Make that cat go away!
Line 63: Tell that Cat in the Hat
Line 64: You do NOT want to play.
Line 65: He should not be here.
Line 66: He should not be about.
Line 67: He should not be here
Line 68: When your mother is out!"
Line 69: 
Line 70: "Now! Now! Have no fear.
Line 71: Have no fear!" said the cat.
Line 72: "My tricks are not bad,"
Line 73: Said the Cat in the Hat.
Line 74: "Why, we can have
Line 75: Lots of good fun, if you wish,
Line 76: with a game that I call
Line 77: UP-UP-UP with a fish!"
Line 78: 
Line 79: "Put me down!" said the fish.
Line 80: "This is no fun at all!
Line 81: Put me down!" said the fish.
Line 82: "I do NOT wish to fall!"
Line 83: 
Line 84: "Have no fear!" said the cat.
Line 85: "I will not let you fall.
Line 86: I will hold you up high
Line 87: As I stand on a ball.
Line 88: With a book on one hand!
Line 89: And a cup on my hat!
Line 90: But that is not ALL I can do!"
Line 91: Said the cat...
Line 92: 
Line 93: "Look at me!
Line 94: Look at me now!" said the cat.
Line 95: "With a cup and a cake
Line 96: On the top of my hat!
Line 97: I can hold up TWO books!
Line 98: I can hold up the fish!
Line 99: And a litte toy ship!
Line 100: And some milk on a dish!
Line 101: And look!
Line 102: I can hop up and down on the ball!
Line 103: But that is not all!
Line 104: Oh, no.
Line 105: That is not all...
Line 106: 
Line 107: "Look at me!
Line 108: Look at me!
Line 109: Look at me NOW!
Line 110: It is fun to have fun
Line 111: But you have to know how.
Line 112: I can hold up the cup
Line 113: And the milk and the cake!
Line 114: I can hold up these books!
Line 115: And the fish on a rake!
Line 116: I can hold the toy ship
Line 117: And a little toy man!
Line 118: And look! With my tail
Line 119: I can hold a red fan!
Line 120: I can fan with the fan
Line 121: As I hop on the ball!
Line 122: But that is not all.
Line 123: Oh, no.
Line 124: That is not all...."
Line 125: 
Line 126: That is what the cat said...
Line 127: Then he fell on his head!
Line 128: He came down with a bump
Line 129: From up there on the ball.
Line 130: And Sally and I,
Line 131: We saw ALL the things fall!
Line 132: 
Line 133: And our fish came down, too.
Line 134: He fell into a pot!
Line 135: He said, "Do I like this?"
Line 136: Oh, no! I do not.
Line 137: This is not a good game,"
Line 138: Said our fish as he lit.
Line 139: "No, I do not like it,
Line 140: Not one little bit!"
Line 141: 
Line 142: "Now look what you did!"
Line 143: Said the fish to the cat.
Line 144: "Now look at this house!
Line 145: Look at this! Look at that!
Line 146: You sank our toy ship,
Line 147: Sank it deep in the cake.
Line 148: You shook up our house
Line 149: And you bent our new rake.
Line 150: You SHOULD NOT be here
Line 151: When our mother is not.
Line 152: You get out of this house!"
Line 153: Said the fish in the pot.
Line 154: 
Line 155: "But I like to be here.
Line 156: Oh, I like it a lot!"
Line 157: Said the Cat in the Hat
Line 158: To the fish in the pot.
Line 159: "I will NOT go away.
Line 160: I do NOT wish to go!
Line 161: And so," said the Cat in the Hat,
Line 162: 
Line 163: "So
Line 164: so
Line 165: so...
Line 166: 
Line 167: I will show you
Line 168: Another good game that I know!"
Line 169: And then he ran out.
Line 170: And, then, fast as a fox,
Line 171: The Cat in the Hat
Line 172: Came back in with a box.
Line 173: A big red wood box.
Line 174: It was shut with a hook.
Line 175: "Now look at this trick,"
Line 176: Said the cat.
Line 177: "Take a look!"
Line 178: 
Line 179: Then he got up on top
Line 180: With a tip of his hat.
Line 181: "I call this game FUN-IN-A-BOX,"
Line 182: Said the cat.
Line 183: "In this box are two things
Line 184: I will show to you now.
Line 185: You will like these two things,"
Line 186: Said the cat with a bow.
Line 187: 
Line 188: "I will pick up the hook.
Line 189: You will see something new.
Line 190: Two things. And I call them
Line 191: Thing One and Thing Two.
Line 192: These Things will not bite you.
Line 193: They want to have fun."
Line 194: Then, out of the box
Line 195: Came Thing Two and Thing One!
Line 196: And they ran to us fast.
Line 197: They said, "How do you do?
Line 198: Would you like to shake hands
Line 199: With Thing One and Thing Two?"
Line 200: 
Line 201: And Sally and I
Line 202: Did not know what to do.
Line 203: So we had to shake hands
Line 204: With Thing One and Thing Two.
Line 205: We shook their two hands.
Line 206: But our fish said, "No! No!
Line 207: Those Things should not be
Line 208: In this house! Make them go!
Line 209: "They should not be here
Line 210: When your mother is not!
Line 211: Put them out! Put them out!"
Line 212: Said the fish in the pot.
Line 213: 
Line 214: "Have no fear, little fish,"
Line 215: Said the Cat in the Hat.
Line 216: "These Things are good Things."
Line 217: And he gave them a pat.
Line 218: "They are tame. Oh, so tame!
Line 219: They have come here to play.
Line 220: They will give you some fun
Line 221: On this wet, wet, wet day."
Line 222: 
Line 223: "Now, here is a game that they like,"
Line 224: Said the cat.
Line 225: "They like to fly kites,"
Line 226: Said the Cat in the Hat
Line 227: 
Line 228: "No! Not in the house!"
Line 229: Said the fish in the pot.
Line 230: "They should not fly kites
Line 231: In a house! They should not.
Line 232: Oh, the things they will bump!
Line 233: Oh, the things they will hit!
Line 234: Oh, I do not like it!
Line 235: Not one little bit!" Then Sally and I
Line 236: Saw them run down the hall.
Line 237: We saw those two Things
Line 238: Bump their kites on the wall!
Line 239: Bump! Thump! Thump! Bump!
Line 240: Down the wall in the hall.
Line 241: 
Line 242: Thing Two and Thing One!
Line 243: They ran up! They ran down!
Line 244: On the string of one kite
Line 245: We saw Mother's new gown!
Line 246: Her gown with the dots
Line 247: That are pink, white and red.
Line 248: Then we saw one kite bump
Line 249: On the head of her bed!
Line 250: 
Line 251: Then those Things ran about
Line 252: With big bumps, jumps and kicks
Line 253: And with hops and big thumps
Line 254: And all kinds of bad tricks.
Line 255: And I said,
Line 256: "I do NOT like the way that they play
Line 257: If Mother could see this,
Line 258: Oh, what would she say!"
Line 259: 
Line 260: Then our fish said, "Look! Look!"
Line 261: And our fish shook with fear.
Line 262: "Your mother is on her way home!
Line 263: Do you hear?
Line 264: Oh, what will she do to us?
Line 265: What will she say?
Line 266: Oh, she will not like it
Line 267: To find us this way!"
Line 268: 
Line 269: "So, DO something! Fast!" said the fish.
Line 270: "Do you hear!
Line 271: I saw her. Your mother!
Line 272: Your mother is near!
Line 273: So, as fast as you can,
Line 274: Think of something to do!
Line 275: You will have to get rid of
Line 276: Thing One and Thing Two!"
Line 277: 
Line 278: So, as fast as I could,
Line 279: I went after my net.
Line 280: And I said, "With my net
Line 281: I can get them I bet.
Line 282: I bet, with my net,
Line 283: I can get those Things yet!"
Line 284: 
Line 285: Then I let down my net.
Line 286: It came down with a PLOP!
Line 287: And I had them! At last!
Line 288: Thoe two Things had to stop.
Line 289: Then I said to the cat,
Line 290: "Now you do as I say.
Line 291: You pack up those Things
Line 292: And you take them away!"
Line 293: 
Line 294: "Oh dear!" said the cat,
Line 295: "You did not like our game...
Line 296: Oh dear.
Line 297: 
Line 298: What a shame!
Line 299: What a shame!
Line 300: What a shame!"
Line 301: 
Line 302: Then he shut up the Things
Line 303: In the box with the hook.
Line 304: And the cat went away
Line 305: With a sad kind of look.
Line 306: 
Line 307: "That is good," said the fish.
Line 308: "He has gone away. Yes.
Line 309: But your mother will come.
Line 310: She will find this big mess!
Line 311: And this mess is so big
Line 312: And so deep and so tall,
Line 313: We ca not pick it up.
Line 314: There is no way at all!"
Line 315: 
Line 316: And THEN!
Line 317: Who was back in the house?
Line 318: Why, the cat!
Line 319: "Have no fear of this mess,"
Line 320: Said the Cat in the Hat.
Line 321: "I always pick up all my playthings
Line 322: And so...
Line 323: I will show you another
Line 324: Good trick that I know!"
Line 325: 
Line 326: Then we saw him pick up
Line 327: All the things that were down.
Line 328: He picked up the cake,
Line 329: And the rake, and the gown,
Line 330: And the milk, and the strings,
Line 331: And the books, and the dish,
Line 332: And the fan, and the cup,
Line 333: And the ship, and the fish.
Line 334: And he put them away.
Line 335: Then he said, "That is that."
Line 336: And then he was gone
Line 337: With a tip of his hat.
Line 338: 
Line 339: Then our mother came in
Line 340: And she said to us two,
Line 341: "Did you have any fun?
Line 342: Tell me. What did you do?"
Line 343: 
Line 344: And Sally and I did not know
Line 345: What to say.
Line 346: Should we tell her
Line 347: The things that went on there that day?
Line 348: 
Line 349: Should we tell her about it?
Line 350: Now, what SHOULD we do?
Line 351: Well...
Line 352: What would YOU do
Line 353: If your mother asked YOU?

Line 758: How The Grinch Stole Christmas
Line 759: by Dr. Suess
Line 760: 
Line 761: Every Who Down in Whoville Liked Christmas a lot...
Line 762: But the Grinch,Who lived just north of Whoville, Did NOT!
Line 763: The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season!
Line 764: Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.
Line 765: It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right.
Line 766: It could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight.
Line 767: But I think that the most likely reason of all,
Line 768: May have been that his heart was two sizes too small.
Line 769: Whatever the reason, His heart or his shoes,
Line 770: He stood there on Christmas Eve, hating the Whos,
Line 771: Staring down from his cave with a sour, Grinchy frown,
Line 772: At the warm lighted windows below in their town.
Line 773: For he knew every Who down in Whoville beneath,
Line 774: Was busy now, hanging a mistletoe wreath.
Line 775: "And they're hanging their stockings!" he snarled with a sneer,
Line 776: "Tomorrow is Christmas! It's practically here!"
Line 777: Then he growled, with his Grinch fingers nervously drumming,
Line 778: "I MUST find some way to stop Christmas from coming!"
Line 779: For Tomorrow, he knew, all the Who girls and boys,
Line 780: Would wake bright and early. They'd rush for their toys!
Line 781: And then! Oh, the noise! Oh, the Noise!
Line 782: Noise! Noise! Noise!
Line 783: That's one thing he hated! The NOISE!
Line 784: NOISE! NOISE! NOISE!
Line 785: Then the Whos, young and old, would sit down to a feast.
Line 786: And they'd feast! And they'd feast! And they'd FEAST!
Line 787: FEAST! FEAST! FEAST!
Line 788: They would feast on Who-pudding, and rare Who-roast beast.
Line 789: Which was something the Grinch couldn't stand in the least!
Line 790: And THEN They'd do something He liked least of all!
Line 791: Every Who down in Whoville, the tall and the small,
Line 792: Would stand close together, with Christmas bells ringing.
Line 793: They'd stand hand-in-hand. And the Whos would start singing!
Line 794: They'd sing! And they'd sing! And they'd SING!
Line 795: SING! SING! SING!
Line 796: And the more the Grinch thought of this Who ChristmasSing,
Line 797: The more the Grinch thought, "I must stop this whole thing!"
Line 798: "Why, for fifty-three years I've put up with it now!"
Line 799: "I MUST stop this Christmas from coming! But HOW?"
Line 800: Then he got an idea! An awful idea!
Line 801: THE GRINCH GOT A WONDERFUL, AWFUL IDEA!
Line 802: "I know just what to do!" The Grinch laughed in his throat.
Line 803: And he made a quick Santy Claus hat and a coat.
Line 804: And he chuckled, and clucked, "What a great Grinchy trick!"
Line 805: "With this coat and this hat, I look just like Saint Nick!"
Line 806: "All I need is a reindeer..." The Grinch looked around.
Line 807: But, since reindeer are scarce, there was none to be found.
Line 808: Did that stop the old Grinch? No! The Grinch simply said,
Line 809: "If I can't find a reindeer, I'll make one instead!"
Line 810: So he called his dog, Max. Then he took some red thread,
Line 811: And he tied a big horn on the top of his head.
Line 812: THEN He loaded some bags And some old empty sacks,
Line 813: On a ramshackle sleigh And he hitched up old Max.
Line 814: Then the Grinch said, "Giddap!" And the sleigh started down,
Line 815: Toward the homes where the Whos Lay asnooze in their town.
Line 816: All their windows were dark. Quiet snow filled the air.
Line 817: All the Whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care.
Line 818: When he came to the first little house on the square.
Line 819: "This is stop number one," the old Grinchy Claus hissed,
Line 820: And he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist.
Line 821: Then he slid down the chimney. A rather tight pinch.
Line 822: But, if Santa could do it, then so could the Grinch.
Line 823: He got stuck only once, for a moment or two.
Line 824: Then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue.
Line 825: Where the little Who stockings all hung in a row.
Line 826: "These stockings," he grinned, "are the first things to go!"
Line 827: Then he slithered and slunk, with a smile most unpleasant,
Line 828: Around the whole room, and he took every present!
Line 829: Pop guns! And bicycles! Roller skates! Drums!
Line 830: Checkerboards! Tricycles! Popcorn! And plums!
Line 831: And he stuffed them in bags. Then the Grinch, very nimbly,
Line 832: Stuffed all the bags, one by one, up the chimney!
Line 833: Then he slunk to the icebox. He took the Whos' feast!
Line 834: He took the Who-pudding! He took the roast beast!
Line 835: He cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash.
Line 836: Why, that Grinch even took their last can of Who-hash!
Line 837: Then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee.
Line 838: "And NOW!" grinned the Grinch, "I will stuff up the tree!"
Line 839: And the Grinch grabbed the tree, and he started to shove,
Line 840: When he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove.
Line 841: He turned around fast, and he saw a small Who!
Line 842: Little Cindy-Lou Who, who was not more than two.
Line 843: The Grinch had been caught by this tiny Who daughter,
Line 844: Who'd got out of bed for a cup of cold water.
Line 845: She stared at the Grinch and said, "Santy Claus, why,?
Line 846: "Why are you taking our Christmas tree? WHY?"
Line 847: But, you know, that old Grinch was so smart and so slick,
Line 848: He thought up a lie, and he thought it up quick!
Line 849: "Why, my sweet little tot," the fake Santy Claus lied,
Line 850: "There's a light on this tree that won't light on one side."
Line 851: "So I'm taking it home to my workshop, my dear."
Line 852: "I'll fix it up there. Then I'll bring it back here."
Line 853: And his fib fooled the child. Then he patted her head,
Line 854: And he got her a drink and he sent her to bed.
Line 855: And when CindyLou Who went to bed with her cup,
Line 856: HE went to the chimney and stuffed the tree up!
Line 857: Then the last thing he took Was the log for their fire!
Line 858: Then he went up the chimney, himself, the old liar.
Line 859: On their walls he left nothing but hooks and some wire.
Line 860: And the one speck of food That he left in the house,
Line 861: Was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse.
Line 862: Then He did the same thing To the other Whos' houses
Line 863: Leaving crumbs Much too small For the other Whos' mouses!
Line 864: It was quarter past dawn... All the Whos, still a-bed,
Line 865: All the Whos, still asnooze When he packed up his sled,
Line 866: Packed it up with their presents! The ribbons! The wrappings!
Line 867: The tags! And the tinsel! The trimmings! The trappings!
Line 868: Three thousand feet up! Up the side of Mt. Crumpit,
Line 869: He rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it!
Line 870: "PoohPooh to the Whos!" he was grinchishly humming.
Line 871: "They're finding out now that no Christmas is coming!"
Line 872: "They're just waking up! I know just what they'll do!"
Line 873: "Their mouths will hang open a minute or two,
Line 874: Then the Whos down in Whoville will all cry BooHoo!"
Line 875: "That's a noise," grinned the Grinch, "That I simply MUST hear!"
Line 876: So he paused. And the Grinch put his hand to his ear.
Line 877: And he did hear a sound rising over the snow.
Line 878: It started in low. Then it started to grow.
Line 879: But the sound wasn't sad! Why, this sound sounded merry!
Line 880: It couldn't be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!
Line 881: He stared down at Whoville! The Grinch popped his eyes!
Line 882: Then he shook! What he saw was a shocking surprise!
Line 883: Every Who down in Whoville, the tall and the small,
Line 884: Was singing! Without any presents at all!
Line 885: He HADN'T stopped Christmas from coming! IT CAME!
Line 886: Somehow or other, it came just the same!
Line 887: And the Grinch, with his grinch-feet ice-cold in the snow,
Line 888: Stood puzzling and puzzling: "How could it be so?"
Line 889: "It came with out ribbons! It came without tags!"
Line 890: "It came without packages, boxes or bags!"
Line 891: And he puzzled three hours, till his puzzler was sore.
Line 892: Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before!
Line 893: "Maybe Christmas," he thought, "doesn't come from a store."
Line 894: "Maybe Christmas...perhaps...means a little bit more!"
Line 895: And what happened then? Well...in Whoville they say,
Line 896: That the Grinch's small heart Grew three sizes that day!
Line 897: And the minute his heart didn't feel quite so tight,
Line 898: He whizzed with his load through the bright morning light,
Line 899: And he brought back the toys! And the food for the feast!
Line 900: And he, HE HIMSELF! The Grinch carved the roast beast!

Line 1052: We saw him sit and try to cook
Line 0: The Cat in the Hat
Line 1: By Dr. Seuss
Line 2: 
Line 3: The sun did not shine.
Line 4: It was too wet to play.
Line 5: wow!
Line 6: All that cold, cold, wet day.
Line 7: 
Line 8: I sat there with Sally.
Line 9: We sat there, we two.
Line 10: And I said, "How I wish
Line 11: We had something to do!"
Line 12: 
Line 13: Too wet to go out
Line 14: And too cold to play ball.
Line 15: So we sat in the house.
Line 16: We did nothing at all.
Line 17: 
Line 18: So all we could do was to
Line 19: 
Line 20: Sit!
Line 21: Sit!
Line 22: Sit!
Line 23: Sit!
Line 24: 
Line 25: And we did not like it.
Line 26: Not one little bit.
Line 27: 
Line 28: BUMP!
Line 29: 
Line 30: And then
Line 31: something went BUMP!
Line 32: How that bump made us jump!
Line 33: 
Line 34: We looked!
Line 35: Then we saw him step in on the mat!
Line 36: We looked!
Line 37: And we saw him!
Line 38: The Cat in the Hat!
Line 39: And he said to us,
Line 40: "Why do you sit there like that?"
Line 41: "I know it is wet
Line 42: And the sun is not sunny.
Line 43: But we can have
Line 44: Lots of good fun that is funny!"
Line 45: 
Line 46: "I know some good games we could play,"
Line 47: Said the cat.
Line 48: "I know some new tricks,"
Line 49: Said the Cat in the Hat.
Line 50: "A lot of good tricks.
Line 51: I will show them to you.
Line 52: Your mother
Line 53: Will not mind at all if I do."
Line 54: 
Line 55: Then Sally and I
Line 56: Did not know what to say.
Line 57: Our mother was out of the house
Line 58: For the day.
Line 59: 
Line 60: But our fish said, "No! No!
Line 61: Make that cat go away!
Line 62: Tell that Cat in the Hat
Line 63: You do NOT want to play.
Line 64: He should not be here.
Line 65: He should not be about.
Line 66: He should not be here
Line 67: When your mother is out!"
Line 68: 
Line 69: "Now! Now! Have no fear.
Line 70: Have no fear!" said the cat.
Line 71: "My tricks are not bad,"
Line 72: Said the Cat in the Hat.
Line 73: "Why, we can have
Line 74: Lots of good fun, if you wish,
Line 75: with a game that I call
Line 76: UP-UP-UP with a fish!"
Line 77: 
Line 78: "Put me down!" said the fish.
Line 79: "This is no fun at all!
Line 80: Put me down!" said the fish.
Line 81: "I do NOT wish to fall!"
Line 82: 
Line 83: "Have no fear!" said the cat.
Line 84: "I will not let you fall.
Line 85: I will hold you up high
Line 86: As I stand on a ball.
Line 87: With a book on one hand!
Line 88: And a cup on my hat!
Line 89: But that is not ALL I can do!"
Line 90: Said the cat...
Line 91: 
Line 92: "Look at me!
Line 93: Look at me now!" said the cat.
Line 94: "With a cup and a cake
Line 95: On the top of my hat!
Line 96: I can hold up TWO books!
Line 97: I can hold up the fish!
Line 98: And a litte toy ship!
Line 99: And some milk on a dish!
Line 100: And look!
Line 101: I can hop up and down on the ball!
Line 102: But that is not all!
Line 103: Oh, no.
Line 104: That is not all...
Line 105: 
Line 106: "Look at me!
Line 107: Look at me!
Line 108: Look at me NOW!
Line 109: It is fun to have fun
Line 110: But you have to know how.
Line 111: I can hold up the cup
Line 112: And the milk and the cake!
Line 113: I can hold up these books!
Line 114: And the fish on a rake!
Line 115: I can hold the toy ship
Line 116: And a little toy man!
Line 117: And look! With my tail
Line 118: I can hold a red fan!
Line 119: I can fan with the fan
Line 120: As I hop on the ball!
Line 121: But that is not all.
Line 122: Oh, no.
Line 123: That is not all...."
Line 124: 
Line 125: That is what the cat said...
Line 126: Then he fell on his head!
Line 127: He came down with a bump
Line 128: From up there on the ball.
Line 129: And Sally and I,
Line 130: We saw ALL the things fall!
Line 131: 
Line 132: And our fish came down, too.
Line 133: He fell into a pot!
Line 134: He said, "Do I like this?"
Line 135: Oh, no! I do not.
Line 136: This is not a good game,"
Line 137: Said our fish as he lit.
Line 138: "No, I do not like it,
Line 139: Not one little bit!"
Line 140: 
Line 141: "Now look what you did!"
Line 142: Said the fish to the cat.
Line 143: "Now look at this house!
Line 144: Look at this! Look at that!
Line 145: You sank our toy ship,
Line 146: Sank it deep in the cake.
Line 147: You shook up our house
Line 148: And you bent our new rake.
Line 149: You SHOULD NOT be here
Line 150: When our mother is not.
Line 151: You get out of this house!"
Line 152: Said the fish in the pot.
Line 153: 
Line 154: "But I like to be here.
Line 155: Oh, I like it a lot!"
Line 156: Said the Cat in the Hat
Line 157: To the fish in the pot.
Line 158: "I will NOT go away.
Line 159: I do NOT wish to go!
Line 160: And so," said the Cat in the Hat,
Line 161: 
Line 162: "So
Line 163: so
Line 164: so...
Line 165: 
Line 166: I will show you
Line 167: Another good game that I know!"
Line 168: And then he ran out.
Line 169: And, then, fast as a fox,
Line 170: The Cat in the Hat
Line 171: Came back in with a box.
Line 172: A big red wood box.
Line 173: It was shut with a hook.
Line 174: "Now look at this trick,"
Line 175: Said the cat.
Line 176: "Take a look!"
Line 177: 
Line 178: Then he got up on top
Line 179: With a tip of his hat.
Line 180: "I call this game FUN-IN-A-BOX,"
Line 181: Said the cat.
Line 182: "In this box are two things
Line 183: I will show to you now.
Line 184: You will like these two things,"
Line 185: Said the cat with a bow.
Line 186: 
Line 187: "I will pick up the hook.
Line 188: You will see something new.
Line 189: Two things. And I call them
Line 190: Thing One and Thing Two.
Line 191: These Things will not bite you.
Line 192: They want to have fun."
Line 193: Then, out of the box
Line 194: Came Thing Two and Thing One!
Line 195: And they ran to us fast.
Line 196: They said, "How do you do?
Line 197: Would you like to shake hands
Line 198: With Thing One and Thing Two?"
Line 199: 
Line 200: And Sally and I
Line 201: Did not know what to do.
Line 202: So we had to shake hands
Line 203: With Thing One and Thing Two.
Line 204: We shook their two hands.
Line 205: But our fish said, "No! No!
Line 206: Those Things should not be
Line 207: In this house! Make them go!
Line 208: "They should not be here
Line 209: When your mother is not!
Line 210: Put them out! Put them out!"
Line 211: Said the fish in the pot.
Line 212: 
Line 213: "Have no fear, little fish,"
Line 214: Said the Cat in the Hat.
Line 215: "These Things are good Things."
Line 216: And he gave them a pat.
Line 217: "They are tame. Oh, so tame!
Line 218: They have come here to play.
Line 219: They will give you some fun
Line 220: On this wet, wet, wet day."
Line 221: 
Line 222: "Now, here is a game that they like,"
Line 223: Said the cat.
Line 224: "They like to fly kites,"
Line 225: Said the Cat in the Hat
Line 226: 
Line 227: "No! Not in the house!"
Line 228: Said the fish in the pot.
Line 229: "They should not fly kites
Line 230: In a house! They should not.
Line 231: Oh, the things they will bump!
Line 232: Oh, the things they will hit!
Line 233: Oh, I do not like it!
Line 234: Not one little bit!" Then Sally and I
Line 235: Saw them run down the hall.
Line 236: We saw those two Things
Line 237: Bump their kites on the wall!
Line 238: Bump! Thump! Thump! Bump!
Line 239: Down the wall in the hall.
Line 240: 
Line 241: Thing Two and Thing One!
Line 242: They ran up! They ran down!
Line 243: On the string of one kite
Line 244: We saw Mother's new gown!
Line 245: Her gown with the dots
Line 246: That are pink, white and red.
Line 247: Then we saw one kite bump
Line 248: On the head of her bed!
Line 249: 
Line 250: Then those Things ran about
Line 251: With big bumps, jumps and kicks
Line 252: And with hops and big thumps
Line 253: And all kinds of bad tricks.
Line 254: And I said,
Line 255: "I do NOT like the way that they play
Line 256: If Mother could see this,
Line 257: Oh, what would she say!"
Line 258: 
Line 259: Then our fish said, "Look! Look!"
Line 260: And our fish shook with fear.
Line 261: "Your mother is on her way home!
Line 262: Do you hear?
Line 263: Oh, what will she do to us?
Line 264: What will she say?
Line 265: Oh, she will not like it
Line 266: To find us this way!"
Line 267: 
Line 268: "So, DO something! Fast!" said the fish.
Line 269: "Do you hear!
Line 270: I saw her. Your mother!
Line 271: Your mother is near!
Line 272: So, as fast as you can,
Line 273: Think of something to do!
Line 274: You will have to get rid of
Line 275: Thing One and Thing Two!"
Line 276: 
Line 277: So, as fast as I could,
Line 278: I went after my net.
Line 279: And I said, "With my net
Line 280: I can get them I bet.
Line 281: I bet, with my net,
Line 282: I can get those Things yet!"
Line 283: 
Line 284: Then I let down my net.
Line 285: It came down with a PLOP!
Line 286: And I had them! At last!
Line 287: Thoe two Things had to stop.
Line 288: Then I said to the cat,
Line 289: "Now you do as I say.
Line 290: You pack up those Things
Line 291: And you take them away!"
Line 292: 
Line 293: "Oh dear!" said the cat,
Line 294: "You did not like our game...
Line 295: Oh dear.
Line 296: 
Line 297: What a shame!
Line 298: What a shame!
Line 299: What a shame!"
Line 300: 
Line 301: Then he shut up the Things
Line 302: In the box with the hook.
Line 303: And the cat went away
Line 304: With a sad kind of look.
Line 305: 
Line 306: "That is good," said the fish.
Line 307: "He has gone away. Yes.
Line 308: But your mother will come.
Line 309: She will find this big mess!
Line 310: And this mess is so big
Line 311: And so deep and so tall,
Line 312: We ca not pick it up.
Line 313: There is no way at all!"
Line 314: 
Line 315: And THEN!
Line 316: Who was back in the house?
Line 317: Why, the cat!
Line 318: "Have no fear of this mess,"
Line 319: Said the Cat in the Hat.
Line 320: "I always pick up all my playthings
Line 321: And so...
Line 322: I will show you another
Line 323: Good trick that I know!"
Line 324: 
Line 325: Then we saw him pick up
Line 326: All the things that were down.
Line 327: He picked up the cake,
Line 328: And the rake, and the gown,
Line 329: And the milk, and the strings,
Line 330: And the books, and the dish,
Line 331: And the fan, and the cup,
Line 332: And the ship, and the fish.
Line 333: And he put them away.
Line 334: Then he said, "That is that."
Line 335: And then he was gone
Line 336: With a tip of his hat.
Line 337: 
Line 338: Then our mother came in
Line 339: And she said to us two,
Line 340: "Did you have any fun?
Line 341: Tell me. What did you do?"
Line 342: 
Line 343: And Sally and I did not know
Line 344: What to say.
Line 345: Should we tell her
Line 346: The things that went on there that day?
Line 347: 
Line 348: Should we tell her about it?
Line 349: Now, what SHOULD we do?
Line 350: Well...
Line 351: What would YOU do
Line 352: If your mother asked YOU?

Line 757: How The Grinch Stole Christmas
Line 758: by Dr. Suess
Line 759: 
Line 760: Every Who Down in Whoville Liked Christmas a lot...
Line 761: But the Grinch,Who lived just north of Whoville, Did NOT!
Line 762: The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season!
Line 763: Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.
Line 764: It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right.
Line 765: It could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight.
Line 766: But I think that the most likely reason of all,
Line 767: May have been that his heart was two sizes too small.
Line 768: Whatever the reason, His heart or his shoes,
Line 769: He stood there on Christmas Eve, hating the Whos,
Line 770: Staring down from his cave with a sour, Grinchy frown,
Line 771: At the warm lighted windows below in their town.
Line 772: For he knew every Who down in Whoville beneath,
Line 773: Was busy now, hanging a mistletoe wreath.
Line 774: "And they're hanging their stockings!" he snarled with a sneer,
Line 775: "Tomorrow is Christmas! It's practically here!"
Line 776: Then he growled, with his Grinch fingers nervously drumming,
Line 777: "I MUST find some way to stop Christmas from coming!"
Line 778: For Tomorrow, he knew, all the Who girls and boys,
Line 779: Would wake bright and early. They'd rush for their toys!
Line 780: And then! Oh, the noise! Oh, the Noise!
Line 781: Noise! Noise! Noise!
Line 782: That's one thing he hated! The NOISE!
Line 783: NOISE! NOISE! NOISE!
Line 784: Then the Whos, young and old, would sit down to a feast.
Line 785: And they'd feast! And they'd feast! And they'd FEAST!
Line 786: FEAST! FEAST! FEAST!
Line 787: They would feast on Who-pudding, and rare Who-roast beast.
Line 788: Which was something the Grinch couldn't stand in the least!
Line 789: And THEN They'd do something He liked least of all!
Line 790: Every Who down in Whoville, the tall and the small,
Line 791: Would stand close together, with Christmas bells ringing.
Line 792: They'd stand hand-in-hand. And the Whos would start singing!
Line 793: They'd sing! And they'd sing! And they'd SING!
Line 794: SING! SING! SING!
Line 795: And the more the Grinch thought of this Who ChristmasSing,
Line 796: The more the Grinch thought, "I must stop this whole thing!"
Line 797: "Why, for fifty-three years I've put up with it now!"
Line 798: "I MUST stop this Christmas from coming! But HOW?"
Line 799: Then he got an idea! An awful idea!
Line 800: THE GRINCH GOT A WONDERFUL, AWFUL IDEA!
Line 801: "I know just what to do!" The Grinch laughed in his throat.
Line 802: And he made a quick Santy Claus hat and a coat.
Line 803: And he chuckled, and clucked, "What a great Grinchy trick!"
Line 804: "With this coat and this hat, I look just like Saint Nick!"
Line 805: "All I need is a reindeer..." The Grinch looked around.
Line 806: But, since reindeer are scarce, there was none to be found.
Line 807: Did that stop the old Grinch? No! The Grinch simply said,
Line 808: "If I can't find a reindeer, I'll make one instead!"
Line 809: So he called his dog, Max. Then he took some red thread,
Line 810: And he tied a big horn on the top of his head.
Line 811: THEN He loaded some bags And some old empty sacks,
Line 812: On a ramshackle sleigh And he hitched up old Max.
Line 813: Then the Grinch said, "Giddap!" And the sleigh started down,
Line 814: Toward the homes where the Whos Lay asnooze in their town.
Line 815: All their windows were dark. Quiet snow filled the air.
Line 816: All the Whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care.
Line 817: When he came to the first little house on the square.
Line 818: "This is stop number one," the old Grinchy Claus hissed,
Line 819: And he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist.
Line 820: Then he slid down the chimney. A rather tight pinch.
Line 821: But, if Santa could do it, then so could the Grinch.
Line 822: He got stuck only once, for a moment or two.
Line 823: Then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue.
Line 824: Where the little Who stockings all hung in a row.
Line 825: "These stockings," he grinned, "are the first things to go!"
Line 826: Then he slithered and slunk, with a smile most unpleasant,
Line 827: Around the whole room, and he took every present!
Line 828: Pop guns! And bicycles! Roller skates! Drums!
Line 829: Checkerboards! Tricycles! Popcorn! And plums!
Line 830: And he stuffed them in bags. Then the Grinch, very nimbly,
Line 831: Stuffed all the bags, one by one, up the chimney!
Line 832: Then he slunk to the icebox. He took the Whos' feast!
Line 833: He took the Who-pudding! He took the roast beast!
Line 834: He cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash.
Line 835: Why, that Grinch even took their last can of Who-hash!
Line 836: Then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee.
Line 837: "And NOW!" grinned the Grinch, "I will stuff up the tree!"
Line 838: And the Grinch grabbed the tree, and he started to shove,
Line 839: When he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove.
Line 840: He turned around fast, and he saw a small Who!
Line 841: Little Cindy-Lou Who, who was not more than two.
Line 842: The Grinch had been caught by this tiny Who daughter,
Line 843: Who'd got out of bed for a cup of cold water.
Line 844: She stared at the Grinch and said, "Santy Claus, why,?
Line 845: "Why are you taking our Christmas tree? WHY?"
Line 846: But, you know, that old Grinch was so smart and so slick,
Line 847: He thought up a lie, and he thought it up quick!
Line 848: "Why, my sweet little tot," the fake Santy Claus lied,
Line 849: "There's a light on this tree that won't light on one side."
Line 850: "So I'm taking it home to my workshop, my dear."
Line 851: "I'll fix it up there. Then I'll bring it back here."
Line 852: And his fib fooled the child. Then he patted her head,
Line 853: And he got her a drink and he sent her to bed.
Line 854: And when CindyLou Who went to bed with her cup,
Line 855: HE went to the chimney and stuffed the tree up!
Line 856: Then the last thing he took Was the log for their fire!
Line 857: Then he went up the chimney, himself, the old liar.
Line 858: On their walls he left nothing but hooks and some wire.
Line 859: And the one speck of food That he left in the house,
Line 860: Was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse.
Line 861: Then He did the same thing To the other Whos' houses
Line 862: Leaving crumbs Much too small For the other Whos' mouses!
Line 863: It was quarter past dawn... All the Whos, still a-bed,
Line 864: All the Whos, still asnooze When he packed up his sled,
Line 865: Packed it up with their presents! The ribbons! The wrappings!
Line 866: The tags! And the tinsel! The trimmings! The trappings!
Line 867: Three thousand feet up! Up the side of Mt. Crumpit,
Line 868: He rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it!
Line 869: "PoohPooh to the Whos!" he was grinchishly humming.
Line 870: "They're finding out now that no Christmas is coming!"
Line 871: "They're just waking up! I know just what they'll do!"
Line 872: "Their mouths will hang open a minute or two,
Line 873: Then the Whos down in Whoville will all cry BooHoo!"
Line 874: "That's a noise," grinned the Grinch, "That I simply MUST hear!"
Line 875: So he paused. And the Grinch put his hand to his ear.
Line 876: And he did hear a sound rising over the snow.
Line 877: It started in low. Then it started to grow.
Line 878: But the sound wasn't sad! Why, this sound sounded merry!
Line 879: It couldn't be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!
Line 880: He stared down at Whoville! The Grinch popped his eyes!
Line 881: Then he shook! What he saw was a shocking surprise!
Line 882: Every Who down in Whoville, the tall and the small,
Line 883: Was singing! Without any presents at all!
Line 884: He HADN'T stopped Christmas from coming! IT CAME!
Line 885: Somehow or other, it came just the same!
Line 886: And the Grinch, with his grinch-feet ice-cold in the snow,
Line 887: Stood puzzling and puzzling: "How could it be so?"
Line 888: "It came with out ribbons! It came without tags!"
Line 889: "It came without packages, boxes or bags!"
Line 890: And he puzzled three hours, till his puzzler was sore.
Line 891: Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before!
Line 892: "Maybe Christmas," he thought, "doesn't come from a store."
Line 893: "Maybe Christmas...perhaps...means a little bit more!"
Line 894: And what happened then? Well...in Whoville they say,
Line 895: That the Grinch's small heart Grew three sizes that day!
Line 896: And the minute his heart didn't feel quite so tight,
Line 897: He whizzed with his load through the bright morning light,
Line 898: And he brought back the toys! And the food for the feast!
Line 899: And he, HE HIMSELF! The Grinch carved the roast beast!
